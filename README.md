# CHALLENGE 10 SVG LOGO MAKER

## DESCRIPTION
Have you ever just wanted to have a logo? Well now you can! With this program, you can create a simple SVG logo, containing 3 letters. All you have to do is enter 1-3 letters that you would like to have on your logo. Then you will be prompted what colors your would like the text and the shape color to be. Then finally you will be able to choose from 3 different shapes, a circle, a square, and a triangle. Once all these are completed, the program will generate you a SVG logo.

## HOW TO USE
To use this program, it is simple. You must first have node installed. To check if you have it installed, open a new terminal, type 'node --version'.

Once cloned, type 'node index.js' to open the program.
